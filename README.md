# DataID
# 1. Data Identification Number
## Problem
### We get same data (images, pdf, docs etc.) from different users on WhatsApp which consumes space for same data again and again. I hope same problem must be faced by databases of large companies. Same data saved, copied or sent by different users consumes extra space of disk.


## Solution
### My Idea is to embed an identification no. to each bundle of data initially generated. When same data will proceed to next user on same server it will come to know that data is same and it will not allocate extra space on disk for same data again and again.
### It will save huge amount of space on large social networking servers where spamming happens like fire. This can be applied to open source databases so everyone can use this.
